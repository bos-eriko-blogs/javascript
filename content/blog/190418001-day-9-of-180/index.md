Goodbye, VSCode! Hello again, Vim! Okay! I've finally finished moving back to Vim! Why did I move, though? I don't know. I just felt like it. Well, my only problem before with Vim was the fuzzy finder but I managed to fix it here on my Mac so now everything's cool again! Hackerman time! I also made versions on my online repositories. Real nice.
