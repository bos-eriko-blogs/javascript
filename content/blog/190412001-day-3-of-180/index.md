I've finished the app that I'm making for testing purposes of the gem called Devise! I unfortunately haven't had the chance of streaming it since the internet is acting really strange today. Nevertheless, I still did continue with my third day of the challenge. I'm loving Rails more now! Who needs configuration when you have Ruby on Rails? Haha!
