Okay. I know this one is short but we have visitors and I can't focus properly. Neverthless, I still wanted to make a progress today even for a little bit. I promise I'll make the upcoming days more longer. I'll aim for minimum of 5 pomodoro sessions a day.

As for what I did today, I did what I'm good at and that's adding a few styles. Might not be the best site you'll see but there's better experience on this one. Tomorrow I'll add the second model so look forward to it!
