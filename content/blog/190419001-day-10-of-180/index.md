Okay. I was going to try GraphQL but then I thought I should just try everything on the Kuru Anime Server repository instead of just testing it with random repositories. I think it's much better to also have an approach of code refactoring instead of just redoing everything over and over again on different repositories. So I stopped testing GraphQL now and tomorrow I'll probably move on to my main project. It's going to be fun!
