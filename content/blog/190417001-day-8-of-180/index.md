Okay. This is the second day I'm working on my Vim editor and it's taking longer than I expected it to be, but it's fine. I'm enjoying it! I've already installed Tmux and I've set it so that Tmux will automatically open when a zsh shell has been opened. I think that's really convenient. There are still a lot of things I need to work on so that I can be productive again. I have so many ideas that I want to add! I also need to know how to add versions for my Git repository so that I can easily go back to my VSCode settings if I want to. For emergency purposes.
