We count them!? For real, yeah! It seems like, at the time of writing this, I'm at 105th here in the Philippines. Haha! You can check it out [here](https://commits.top/philippines.html) if you want. To be honest, as fun as it sounds, I think this doesn't mean anything. Heck, I push random stuff every now and then. Even my blog needs pushing to GitHub. It's still cool to see, though!
