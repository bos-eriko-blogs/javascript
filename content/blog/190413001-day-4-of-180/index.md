I managed to make an authentication using tokens! This is cool! I'm getting closer and closer to what I wanted to make for Kuru Anime! I'll try to make a proper namespace tomorrow on my routes (using resources). This will be fun! Then on Day 6 I'll do GraphQL! I can't believe I'll be having this much fun using Ruby on Rails!
